    \emph{Dean Of Student Activities} \\
    \emph{Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram}}
  
\opening{Respected Sir,}
We have recently initiated a \texttt{Free and Open Source Software
  Group} (FOSS) in IIST. The group is intended to be a focal point for
FOSS based research and development activities in the areas of Science
and Engineering pertaining to the core research interests of the
students of IIST.

As a formal inauguration to the activities of the group, we would like
to host a meeting on \textbf{Wednesday, 24 August 2016 from 2:45 PM to
  4:15 PM} in the Seminar Hall of D4 Building. \\
We will be grateful if you could provide us with the necessary
permissions to host the inaugural meeting and keep it open for the
faculty, students and staff members of IIST. We would also like to
request explicit permission on behalf of the freshers so that they may
also join us.

\closing{Yours Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
